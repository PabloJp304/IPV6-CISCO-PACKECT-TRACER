# IPv6 Implementation with Cisco Packet Tracer

This project focuses on the implementation and configuration of IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) using the Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation platform.

# The key points of the project are the following:

- Device Configuration: network devices, such as routers and switches, are configured in Cisco Packet Tracer to represent a network topology that supports IPv6.

- IPv6 Address Assignment: IPv6 addresses are assigned to network devices according to IPv6 addressing best practices and standards.

- IPv6 Routing: Routers are configured to support IPv6 routing, including the configuration of static or dynamic routes for IPv6 traffic.

- Connectivity Testing: Extensive connectivity testing is performed between network devices using IPv6, verifying the ability to communicate between nodes and the correct propagation of IPv6 routing tables.

- Security and Policies: Security policies are implemented to protect the IPv6 network, including the configuration of IPv6 access control lists (ACLs) to control incoming and outgoing traffic.

- Troubleshooting: Potential problems and challenges that may arise during IPv6 configuration and deployment are addressed using Cisco Packet Tracer diagnostic and troubleshooting tools.

- Documentation and Evaluation: The IPv6 configuration and testing process is documented in detail, along with the results obtained during the simulation. The effectiveness and efficiency of the IPv6 implementation in the simulated network is evaluated.
